          My name is Mat√≠as and I'm a front-end developer. I grow up in a small
          town called Valle viejo in the province of Catamarca in Argentina, and
          since my parents bring that first computer when I was 8, I was shocked
          by technology, I always followed the news about the new tech thing
          that was coming, and I got my first gaming pc at the age of 18 (a gift
          for my birthday), then my passion about technology didn't do anything
          but growing up, and then in a trip with my family in 2019 (just before pandemic) I
          realized that I wanted to work in Tech somehow, so then it begun my
          passion for the web development. My locked 2020 was a deep learning on coding, now I live with my beatiful
          girlfriend, my cat Sam üêà, and working on something that I love.
